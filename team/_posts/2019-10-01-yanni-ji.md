I am a second year PhD student, under the supervision of Bj√∏rn Sand Jensen and Ke Yuan at University of Glasgow, Computing Science department. My current research is mainly focused on investigating features of single cell images of breast cancer based on deep learning models.

I am interested in generative models, representation learning and cancer cell images analysis. Applying deep learning models to cancer cell images provides an opportunity to figure out the interpretable representations of cancer cell images, which can help us understand cancer cell images and assist pathologists for cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Before coming to Glasgow, I received my bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China. Then I received the degree of MSc in Data Science at University of Glasgow in UK.
