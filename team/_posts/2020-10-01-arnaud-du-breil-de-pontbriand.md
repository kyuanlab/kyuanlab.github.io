I am a masters (MSci) student at the University of Glasgow School of Computing Science, supervised by Dr. Ke Yuan.
My research aims at assessing the danger of deepfake in scientific publishing with a special focus on Western Blot fabrication and falsification.
This involves implementing and training generative models to create and detect realistic fake images of Western blots.
