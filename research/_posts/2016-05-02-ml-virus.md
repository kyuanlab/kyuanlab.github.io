title: Machine Learning for Virus Research

Our effort in virus research is done mostly in collaboration with [Prof David Robertson] (https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/cvr/staff/groups/robertsongroup/) at the CVR. We are part of the Wellcome Trust funded [AFRICO19 consortium](https://wellcome.ac.uk/grant-funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/african-covid-19-preparedness-africo19) led by Prof Matt Cohen to help Africa countries fight COVID19. We focus on developing methods for non PCR-based diagnosis and the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.
