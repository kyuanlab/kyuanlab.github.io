title: Machine Learning for Virus Research

Our effort in virus research is done mostly in collaboration with Prof David Robertson at the CVR. We are part of the Wellcome Trust funded AFRICO19 consortium led by Prof Matt Cohen to help Africa countries fight COVID19. Overall, we focus on developing methods for non PCR-based diagnosis and the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.
