title: Machine Learning for Cancer Research

#### We develop machine learning methods to understand diversities in cancer from genomic data to digital pathology images. 

#### From the genome side, we are interested in understanding intratumour heterogeneity and cancer evolution. Here are the highlights: 

- Ccube: A fast Bayesian mixture model to estimate cancer cell fractions of simple somatic mutations (eg SNV, indel) [paper](/papers/ccube-1st/).
- SVclone: Using Ccube as its engine to estimate cancer cell fractions of structural variants [paper](/papers/svclone-final).
- PCAWG: Ccube and SVclone were used in the successful ICGC-PCAWG project, which analysed ~2700 whole genomes across ~40 cancer types [paper1](/papers/evolution-pcawg11/) [paper2](/papers/portraits-pcawg11).
- BitPhylogeny: A Bayesian nonparametric method to reconstruct intratumour phylogenies [paper](/papers/bitphylogeny/). 

#### From the image side, we are interested in uncovering hidden diversities of the tumour microenvironment using digital pathology images.  

- PathologGAN: A customised general adversarial network that syntheses high quality images while learning interpretable manifold of real images [paper1](/papers/pathology-gan/) [paper2] (/papers/pathology-gan-real/).
